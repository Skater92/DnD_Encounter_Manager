# DnD Encounter Manager

## Intent

This manager is meant to do four things

1) Take in full Monster/NPC statblocks based on the 5th Edition of Dungeons and Dragons through console prompts and store it to a monster object.
2) Save that Monster Object to a JSON File so that it can be used in the future.
3) Read back that JSON File into monster objects at program run
4) (**PLANNED**) Compare Monster Objects to give auto generated combat output based on listed abilities and stats
